# Cats-and-Dogs-Classifier

I tried to use a pretrained model, VGG16 in this case, to do the basic binary classification to explore more into Keras and data processing in general.

* I used the [Miscrosoft Kaggle Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765) for training and testing.
* I followed the tutorial of [Deep Lizard](https://deeplizard.com/learn/playlist/PLZbbT5o_s2xrwRnXk_yCPtnqqo4_u2YGL) for this project.

### Notes
* The VGG16 is computationally intensive to train because of the 138 million parameters compared to a basic neural net (1000 - 100,000 parameters).
